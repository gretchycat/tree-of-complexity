description: |
  The Tree of Complexity offers a bold new framework for understanding life—not just as it exists biologically, but across all substrates, including digital and hypothetical. Building on principles of function and cognition rather than carbon or code, this system classifies life from pre-life through abstract thinkers, applying consistent standards of complexity across biology, AI, and beyond. Designed for technologists, scientists, philosophers, and futurists, this book invites readers to explore the layered architecture of intelligence, awareness, and cooperation—where life is not defined by what it is made of, but by what it can do.
